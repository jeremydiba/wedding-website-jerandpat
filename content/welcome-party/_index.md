title: "Welcome Party"
---

We would love to invite our out of town family and invited guests to a welcome party so that we have the chance to spend more time with everyone who took their weekend to celebrate us, and allow our guests and family to meet before the big day. There will be drinks and a light buffet-style meal / hors d'oeuvres served

# Location

Wild Leap Atlanta, located nearby the Omni Hotel (13 minute walk from hotel, 4 blocks down Ted Turner drive)
