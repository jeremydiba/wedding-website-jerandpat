The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us on our wedding day. However, if you wish to give a gift, we will gratefully accept an item from our registry, or a contribution towards our honeymoon fund.

Our registry currently is not currently setup, so this is just a placeholder. [Registry](https://google.com)

If you are able to, please bring a **fun used tie** that you can part with to the wedding for a special surprise. You don't have to wear it unless you want to!
