The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us on our wedding day. However, if you wish to give a gift, we will gratefully accept an item from our registry, or a contribution towards our honeymoon fund!

We would also like if every person brought a **fun used tie** to the wedding (you do not have to wear it) as we have something special planned!
