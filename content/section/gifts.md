The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us on our wedding day. However, if you wish to give a gift, we will gratefully accept an item from our registry, or a contribution towards our honeymoon fund!

Our registry currently is not setup, so this is just a placeholder! [Registry](https://google.com)

We would also like if every person brought a **fun used tie** to the wedding (you do not have to wear it) as we have something special planned!
