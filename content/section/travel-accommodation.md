The TLDR is:

<br>

The hotel is the Omni Atlanta Hotel at the CNN center. It is less than 3 miles (9 minute uber) to the venue, and in the heart of downtown Atlanta! see Accommodation for more details.

There is parking at the venue available, however, all cars must be picked up by 11AM the next morning

There are two Monday Nights in the city of Atlanta, our venue is Monday Night **GARAGE!**
