## What is the Dress Code?

Cocktail or Semi-Formal attire.

<br>

If you are able to, please bring a **fun used tie** that you can part with to the wedding for a special surprise. You don't have to wear it unless you want to!

## Are Children Invited to the Wedding?

Unless specifically named on the invitation (or included as a part of the wedding party), we will not be inviting our friends under the age of 18. This event is an opportunity for us to celebrate with our loved ones and we do not want anyone missing out on the fun worrying about their little one(s)!

## What else is there to do in Atlanta? 

We are glad you asked! While staying in the heart of the city, there are a lot of fun restaraunts, events, and locations we recommend seeing. Please see our page on <a href="/things-to-do">Things To Do</a>.

## What are the deadlines for RSVP and Hotel Reservations?

The deadline for RSVP is August 16th, please let us know if you cannot decide by that time or have difficult travel plans.  

<br>

The deadline for hotel reservations is 1 month prior, so 5PM on August 8th. If you are looking into the Omni hotel after this date, you can still call the Omni to try and get added to the group, but they do not make guarantees on availability or rate!
