## What is the Dress Code?

We would love everyone to come in Cocktail/Semi-Formal attire!

<br>

We would also **love** if every person/couple brought a used tie they do not care to part with (the more unique the better!)

## Are Children Invited to the Wedding?

Unless specifically named on the invitation (or included as a part of a "family") we will not be inviting our friends under the age of 18. This event is an opportunity for us to celebrate with our loved ones and we do not want anyone missing out on the fun worrying about their little one(s)!

## What else is there to do in Atlanta? 

We are glad you asked! While staying in the heart of the city there are tons of fun restaraunts, events, and locations we recommend seeing! Please see our page on <a href="/things-to-do">Things To Do</a>
