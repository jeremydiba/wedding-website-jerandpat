## What is the Dress Code?

Cocktail or Semi-Formal attire.

<br>

If you are able to, please bring a **fun used tie** that you can part with to the wedding for a special surprise. You don't have to wear it unless you want to!

## Are Children Invited to the Wedding?

Unless specifically named on the invitation (or included as a part of a "family"), we will not be inviting our friends under the age of 18. This event is an opportunity for us to celebrate with our loved ones and we do not want anyone missing out on the fun worrying about their little one(s)!
