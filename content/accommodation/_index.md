## Hotel

We have a group block booked at the Omni Atlanta Hotel at CNN Center and it is where we recommend our guests stay. This being because it is one of the closest available hotels to the venue, is in the heart of most tourism in Atlanta, and will allow friends and family a central meeting spot for the weekend.

Here is the [booking link](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/atlanta-cnn-center/weddings/dibattista-wedding-09052023) - should the block run out of rooms, please reach out to Jeremy or Pat to address the problem. We recommend booking as soon as possible to guarantee the cheapest rate.
