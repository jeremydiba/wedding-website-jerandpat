## Hotel!

We have a block booked at the Omni Hotel in Downtown Atlanta and it is where we recommend our guests stay. This being because it is one of the closest available hotels to the venue, is in the heart of most tourism in Atlanta, and will allow all friends and family a central meeting spot for the weekend.

<br>

Here is our [Booking Link](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/atlanta-cnn-center/weddings/dibattista-wedding-09052023) - should we run out of rooms in our block, please do not hesitate to reach out to Jeremy or Pat and we can address the problem! We recommend booking as soon as possible to guarantee the cheapest rate.
