## Hotel

We have a group block booked at the Omni Atlanta Hotel at CNN Center and it is where we recommend our guests stay. This being because it is one of the closest available hotels to the venue, is in the heart of most tourism in Atlanta, and will allow friends and family a central meeting spot for the weekend.

Here is the [booking link](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/atlanta-cnn-center/weddings/dibattista-wedding-09052023) - should the block run out of rooms, please reach out to Jeremy or Pat to address the problem. We recommend booking as soon as possible to guarantee the cheapest rate.

<br>

The deadline for hotel reservations is 1 month prior, so 5PM on August 8th. If you are looking into the Omni hotel after this date, you can still call the Omni to try and get added to the group, but they do not make guarantees on availability or rate!
