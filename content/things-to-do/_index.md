## Food and Drink

There are a lot of great places around town, for a variety of food options, we recommend Krog Street Market.  They have some of the best Asian cusine (Gu's Dumplings), Cheesesteaks/Sandwiiches (Fred's meat and bread), and casual medeterranian (Yalla), along with dozens more places. 
<br><br>
For the best chicken wings, we recommend The Local, Atlanta on Ponce, and for Burgers, you cannot go wrong with Grindhouse.
<br><br>
For southern comfort food, Mary Mac's tea room is a local favorite with some great Cuban food (Papi's) next door as well.
<br><br>
For Mexican you cannot go wrong with Nuevo Laredo Cantina or  Mezcalitos.
<br><br>
For food by the hotel we recommend Max's Coal Oven Pizzaria and Atlanta Breakfast Club. There are also your choice of fast casual places nearby the hotel or in the CNN center if you are looking for a quick bite!
<br><br>
For drinks nearby the hotel we recommend Top Draft or Park Bar, and a bit further away we recommend Three Taverns Imaginarium, Scofflaw Brewery, The Vortex, and Cypress Street Pint & Plate, and The Albert!

## Tourism / Family Friendly

The hotels are in the heart of downtown, which is also where most family friendly tourism is! Right within walking distance is one of the worlds largest aquariums, the <a href="https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/">Georgia Aquarium</a>.  <a href="https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/">The World of Coke</a> is also a great place to see if you have never been!  If you find yourself with a lot of time, the <a href="https://www.citypass.com/atlanta?mv_source=wocc&campaign=citypass-buynow">Atlanta City Pass</a> can provide good value to all th main attractions! Atlanta is also home to the College Football Hall of Fame!
<br>
Outside of that, there is tons to do and see around the CNN center! 

## Events

It just so happens that the Atlanta Braves will be hosting the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 3 game series Friday to Sunday. There is a 7:20PM game on Friday and an afternoon game (1:30PM) on Sunday for those leaving later on Sunday / Monday!
